# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# User.create(name: "Brett", username: "brett", password: "Brett",password_confirmation: "Brett", account_balance: 10000.00)
# Stock.create(name: "Coca-Cola", symbol: "KO", price_purchased: 45.75, units: 12, status: "Excuted", order:"Buy", user_id: 1)
